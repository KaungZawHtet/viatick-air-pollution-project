# Viatick Air Pollution Test Project

The documentation is built not only for the JS Developers, but also for both of full stack developers from other different fields and those with less technical backgrounds in a team.

## Overview

The entire project is writtin in JavaScript using NodeJS stuff. There are two seperate projects in the repository: api-server(API Server) written in expressJS and ui(UI) written in ReactJS.

To run the project, first you need to step up the server side first. For more info, find out the README.md of api-server directory. After that, step up the client side at ui directory. For more info, check in the README.md of ui directory.

For the plain code review, you can type `.` at the root directory of the project. Then, you will automatically reach to the web-based VS Code editor.

For those who want to review the project on non dev environment, there is a directory named `presentation assets` and you can check those images, powerpoint file and video.
